# 11.1 Directed-Address Table

* element指的是包含key與satellite data的那個node。
* dynamic set指的是only support 'insert', 'search'和'delete'的結構。

當universe of keys足夠小的時候(e.g., U = {0, 1, ..., m-1})，我們可以使用directed-address table，表示為T\[0 : m-1]，來形容這個dynamic set，也就是U內有多少key，我們所建構的array就有多長，若該index無資料則為nil。

而我們要看某key i是否存在，或取用其附帶的資料時，我們只需要從T\[i]即可直接觀察到，因為key也就是table的index。

也因此，尋找key是否存在(search)、插入一個新node(insert)與刪除一個node(delete)，都只需要花O(1)的時間即可完成。

## exercises

1. Suppose that a dynamic set S is represented by a direct-address table T of length m. Describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of S. What is the worst-case performance of your procedure?&#x20;
2. A bit vector is simply an array of bits (0s and 1s). A bit vector of length m takes much less space than an array of m pointers. Describe how to use a bit vector to represent a dynamic set of distinct elements with no satellite data. Dictionary operations should run in O.1/ time.
3. Suggest how to implement a direct-address table in which the keys of stored elements do not need to be distinct and the elements can have satellite data. All three dictionary operations (INSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH) should run in O.1/ time. (Don’t forget that DELETE takes as an argument a pointer to an object to be deleted, not a key.)&#x20;
4. We wish to implement a dictionary by using direct addressing on a huge array. At the start, the array entries may contain garbage, and initializing the entire array is impractical because of its size. Describe a scheme for implementing a directaddress dictionary on a huge array. Each stored object should use O.1/ space; the operations SEARCH, INSERT, and DELETE should take O.1/ time each; and initializing the data structure should take O.1/ time. (Hint: Use an additional array, treated somewhat like a stack whose size is the number of keys actually stored in the dictionary, to help determine whether a given entry in the huge array is valid or not.)
